# Projects

This is a public repository to display a few data science projects I have worked on.

# KMeans_from_scratch:

This is an implementation of KMeans clustering from sratch. It includes analysis of running time across various parameters. In addition, there is a section to showcase image compression using the KMeans algorithm.

# Netflix_AB_Testing_Project:

This is the final project report for my Experiments in Data Science course. This project focused on performing A/B testing in order to identify the ideal levels of a number of various factors which minimizes the user browsing time.

# Arxiv_paper_classification:

The goal of this notebook is to try to classify scientific papers into one of 10 classes. The dataset is from arxiv.org and contains the title, abstract, and label of 10,000 papers. I use Word2Vec to get embeddings for the titles/abstracts and then use a fully connected 3 layer neural network to classify the papers into one of 10 groups.
